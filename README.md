<blockquote>

I software engineer based in London UK. And I love writing code!
  
I care a lot about privacy and security, and have carried out several audits and have made numerous submissions to various bug bounty programs.

I also enjoy attending ([and sometimes winning](https://notes.aliciasykes.com/p/0s5s3uOtKj)) hackathons and coding competitions, as it's a great opportunity to try out new technologies, meet new people and consume a lot of free caffeine.

I have a small homelab, which I'm using to learn more about system administration, and host my own services. 

When I'm not at the keyboard, I like sports, astronomy and hanging out with friends.
